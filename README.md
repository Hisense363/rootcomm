Rootardio $ROOT (V2)

This is a proposal for a new rootlet memecoin that is more aligned with the Rootlet NFT project.

History:

$ROOT(V1) was launched publicly via BlueMove. There was minimal buy-in from the rootlet community. 20% of supply was purchased and airdropped to the community, but it was a very small portion of tokens. The price cratered until recently, when a revival attempt occured.

Problems:

1. Limited memeability. "Rootlet" is not a good meme. Unless you are already familiar with the NFT, you won't even know what it is. It should quickly grab attention and explain itself.
2. Poorly aligned. $ROOT success is not tied to Rootlet's success. They feel disconnected. Only some of the community get's to participate.
3. Poor distribution. 20% share is not enough to embrace this as a community coin.

The only upside in the current coin is it's hasty launch, and distribution could be seen as so bad that it almost fit's the rootarded brand.

Proposal:

$ROOT(V2)

A finite supply of 10,000,000,000 tokens. 7,000,000,000 distributed to Rootlet Holder's over 6 months. 2,000,000,000 to be held by the $ROOT DAO to be used as Rootlet holder's see fit, and 1,000,000,000 to be airdropped to V1 holders.

Solutions:
1. Memeability. We can choose a more memeable name/token image design. Rootardio would be one example, but ultimately these should be decided by the community.
2. Well aligned. Because these would be dropped to Rootlet NFTs over the course of 6 months, the success of $ROOT would increase the price of the NFTs as future airdrops would have to be factored in to floor price.
3. Good distribution. Every Rootlet would share in the success of $ROOT, and minimal would go to outsiders.

Another benefit is that we would have an ample treasury to spend on any community initiatives and support now that capsules are coming to a close.
